		WHAT IS DECLARATION, DEFINITION & INITIALIZATION

1.   Declaration is registering a variable using a given name within the corresponding scope.
     For example; var x;  
     Whereby, x is the variable registered.
2.   Definition is the assignment of a  specified value to the variable
     For example; var x = 2
     Whereby, 2 is the value assigned to variable x.
3.   Initialization is the specification of the initial value to be stored in an object, 
     which is not necessarily the same as the first time you explicitly assign a value to it.
