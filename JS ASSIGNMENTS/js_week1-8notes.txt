	   Variables and Types
=>Variable means anything that vary.JS has variables that carry data value and the variables are mutable(changeable).
=>Variables are assigned a value using(=)sign e.g
   Var number = 1; //the variable type is a number
   Var string = "Hello"//the variable type is a string ("")
   Var boolean = true;//the variable type is boolean with (true or false)
		   
=>There are two other types in JS:
  Var myArray=[];
  Var myObject={};
  Var undefined; //when the variable is used without first givin it a value it equals to undefined
  Var null = null; //it is used when the variable should be marked as empty
